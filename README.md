stringart
=========
This is a tool for designing string art like that:  
<img src="images/mine2.jpg?raw=true" width="400">
<img src="images/mine1.jpg?raw=true" width="400">


Ok, that one is pretty simple. But now have a look at this one, which is taken from [this beautiful youtube video][yt] by Aline Campbell (more [here][playlist] and [here][instagram]), which inspired me to do all of this in the first place:  
<img src="images/red and blue.jpg?raw=true" width="500">

#### Usage
It's hosted at https://mihi314.github.io/stringart/, but make sure to use chrome, as it will probably not work properly in other browsers.
