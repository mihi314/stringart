StringArt
=========
StringArt is a tool for designing string art like this:
<img src="images/mine1.jpg?raw=true" width="400">
<img src="images/mine2.jpg?raw=true" width="400">

Ok, that one was pretty simple. But now have a look at this one, which is taken from [this beautiful youtube video][yt], which inspired me to do all of this in the first place:
<img src="images/red and blue.jpg?raw=true" width="500">

#### Usage
It's hosted at TODO, but make sure to use chrome, as it will probably not work properly in other browsers.
